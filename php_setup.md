## PHP/Laravel Tools

### PHP
```sh
brew install php
```
the above command install the latest PHP, to install a specific version of PHP other than the latest version you need to use the @ notation. For example : `brew install php@7.4`.
If you already have a version of PHP installed and need to switch to another version, you need to first unlink the version youâ€™re running and link the new version. For example:
```sh
brew unlink php@8.1
brew link php@7.4
```


### composer
```sh
brew install composer
```
Add the following line to `.bash_profile` file:
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

### Laravel Valet
```sh
composer global require laravel/valet
```
then config and install Valet and DnsMasq
```sh
valet install
```

### DBngin
download and install [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/)

### PHP Monitor for Valet
[phpmon](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/phpmon) is a lightweight macOS utility app that runs on your Mac and displays the active PHP version in your status bar. It's tightly integrated with Laravel Valet.
```sh
brew tap nicoverbruggen/homebrew-cask
brew install --cask phpmon
```

### Valet Launchpad
[Valet Launchpad](https://github.com/gbuckingham89/valet-launchpad): A web based UI for browsing the projects being served by Laravel Valet, show all the projects being served by Laravel Valet, give you quick access to all the URLs it's served via (linked or parked) and will highlight if there is a match / mismatch with your current PHP version. 


### Mailhog
```sh
brew install mailhog
brew services start mailhog
```
After that we can access mailhog web interface here:
[mailhog web](http://127.0.0.1:8025/)

To stop the service:
```sh
brew services stop mailhog
```

May need to add this line in `php.ini` file:
```sh
sendmail_path = /usr/local/bin/MailHog sendmail
```

## Node.js
have to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple versions as laravel 7 has 'opensslErrorStack' error if using node 17+.

first, uninstall existing node
```sh
brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node
brew uninstall --force node
```
Install NVM using Homebrew
```sh
brew install nvm
nvm install --lts ### As of Jan, 18m 2023, the version is v18.13
nvm install 16.19
nvm use 16 ### node --version will output v16.19.0
nvm ls ### list all installed versions
nvm alias default 16.19 ### set default version of node
```

**For Apple M1, versions under Node 14 are not supported. so we need to install them via Rosetta**
How to open the terminal in Rosetta2 mode: 
 - Go to Application -> Right click on terminal app -> Get Info -> Select "Open using Rosetta" -> Restart Terminal
In Terminal, write -> arch -x86_64 zsh or arch -x86_64 zsh
then run `nvm install 14`

**Notes on July 5, 2023, use PNPM for node package management**

download and install [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
