## PHP/Laravel Tools

### PHP

brew install php
```
the above command install the latest PHP, to install a specific version of PHP other than the latest version you need to use the @ notation. For example : `brew install php@7.4`.
If you already have a version of PHP installed and need to switch to another version, you need to first unlink the version youâ€™re running and link the new version. For example:
```sh
brew unlink php@8.1
brew link php@7.4
```


### composer
```sh
brew install composer
```
Add the following line to `.bash_profile` file:
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

### Laravel Valet
```sh
composer global require laravel/valet
```
then config and install Valet and DnsMasq
```sh
valet install
```

### DBngin

### PHP Monitor for Valet
[phpmon](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/phpmon) is a lightweight macOS utility app that runs on your Mac and displays the active PHP version in your status bar. It's tightly integrated with Laravel Valet.
```sh
brew tap nicoverbruggen/homebrew-cask
brew install --cask phpmon
